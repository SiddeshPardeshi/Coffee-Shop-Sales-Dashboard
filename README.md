# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Dashboard


# About this Project

## Project Introduction
This project focused on analyzing transaction-level sales data from Maven Coffee Shop to uncover key business metrics. The primary goal was to create an interactive and dynamic dashboard that allows franchise owners to monitor revenue trends, evaluate product performance, and understand customer purchasing patterns. The dashboard offers actionable insights to support data-driven decisions and business growth.

## Key Insights
1. Consistent growth is observed from January ($81.7K) to June ($166.5K), with the highest revenue recorded in June.
2. Friday, Thursday, and Monday have the highest transaction counts (~21.7K each). Saturday has the lowest transaction volume (20.5K).
3. Morning hours (9 AM – 11 AM) are critical for sales, suggesting the importance of staffing and inventory management during this period.
4. Coffee and tea bring in most of the revenue, so focusing on promotions or bundling deals with these popular items could be a great way to boost sales.

## Conclusion
The dashboard shows that coffee and tea bring in most of the sales, making them the main products to focus on. The Hell's Kitchen store earns the highest revenue, and the busiest times are around 10 AM and 9 AM. Fridays and Thursdays have the most transactions, while Saturdays are the slowest. To boost sales, it’s a good idea to promote coffee and tea, have more staff during peak hours, and find ways to attract more customers on weekends.
